I am interested in leveraging my 17 Years experience in the computer software and hardware field, as well as quality management and operations to help drive continuous improvement and growth. 

It is impossible for me to go in-depth or even list all of the software, hardware and projects i've worked with. I prefer to have a discussion about your business or project in depth so that I can offer insight into specific projects, technologies, software or experience I have that I believe can be valuable.
